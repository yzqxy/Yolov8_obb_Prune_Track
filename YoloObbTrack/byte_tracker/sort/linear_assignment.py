    Parameters
    ----------
    distance_metric : Callable[List[Track], List[Detection], List[int], List[int]) -> ndarray
        The distance metric is given a list of tracks and detections as well as
        a list of N track indices and M detection indices. The metric should
        return the NxM dimensional cost matrix, where element (i, j) is the
        association cost between the i-th track in the given track indices and
        the j-th detection in the given detection_indices.
    max_distance : float
        Gating threshold. Associations with cost larger than this value are
        disregarded.
    tracks : List[track.Track]
        A list of predicted tracks at the current time step.
    detections : List[detection.Detection]
        A list of detections at the current time step.
    track_indices : List[int]
        List of track indices that maps rows in `cost_matrix` to tracks in
        `tracks` (see description above).
    detection_indices : List[int]
        List of detection indices that maps columns in `cost_matrix` to
        detections in `detections` (see description above).
    Returns
    -------
    (List[(int, int)], List[int], List[int])
        Returns a tuple with the following three entries:
        * A list of matched track and detection indices.
        * A list of unmatched track indices.
        * A list of unmatched detection indices.
